    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Learn Enough Story</h1>
    <p>Learn enought to be dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
      <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
      command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
      everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
      We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can
       benefit from
      learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our movement,

      HTML was created by the original "web developer" , computer scientist
      <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners_Lee"target="_blank"
      style="text-decoration: none underline;">
      Tim Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
      share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

      <h2>Quotations</h2>
      <p>
        in addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos
        ,the web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than
        this one:
        </p>
      <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #ccc;">
        <p>
          <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the internet.</em>
          <br>
          -Abraham Lincoln
        </p>
